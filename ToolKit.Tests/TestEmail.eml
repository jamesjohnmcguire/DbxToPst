Does anyone have anything nice to say about FOMA? Dow Jones reported 
(quoting a DoCoMo spokeswomen) that DoCoMo sold 17,000 FOMA handsets 
(Fujitsu - Jan 18, and NEC - Jan 23) as of Feb 04. That means 17,000 
FOMA handsets sold in a little over 2 weeks. Also, the TCA reported that 
DoCoMo only put on 2,600 (about - too lazy to check) new W-CDMA subs in 
January, which is a contradiction... Are people on the list buying these 
handsets to test?
